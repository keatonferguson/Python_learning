# **Python Basics and Data Analysis Lesson Plan**

## **Overview**
This lesson introduces Python programming basics and practical data analysis techniques. Students will define and use functions, handle CSV data, and fit data with linear and Gaussian models through hands-on activities and exercises.

---

## **Lesson Highlights**
1. **Python Functions**: Learn syntax, modularity, and write functions like calculating grades or medians. Use flowcharts to visualize workflows.
2. **CSV Handling**: Import, preprocess, and clean data using `pandas`. Work with datasets like sales or weather data.
3. **Linear Fitting**: Fit data with `numpy.polyfit` and `scipy.stats.linregress`. Visualize results with `matplotlib` and interpret R-squared metrics.
4. **Gaussian Fitting**: Advanced fitting with `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`. Analyze parameters and avoid overfitting. Start with single Gaussian models before expanding to sums.
5. **Mini-Project**: Analyze a dataset of choice using techniques learned. Reflect on challenges and real-world applications.
